# Dragon-Smp-Plugin
The Dragon Smp Plugin's buggy code
The Health Enchant is comments right now becuase I have yet to fix it as it overrides the current attributes and I can't find a way to get the old attributes and apply it without breaking things.
Null Pointer Exeption errors keep happening
This blocks the use of Tipped Arrows, Respawn Anchors and End Crystals.
Makes a axolottl bucket say "Depression & ItzDax" everytime you move.
